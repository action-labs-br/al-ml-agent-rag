# Commander Format: The Most Popular Way to Play Magic

## Overview

Commander (originally known as Elder Dragon Highlander, or EDH) is the most popular constructed format in Magic: The Gathering. Wizards of the Coast reported in 2023 that Commander accounts for over 50% of all Magic play sessions worldwide. It is a multiplayer, singleton format built around a legendary creature that serves as the player's "commander."

## Core Rules

### Deck Construction

Every Commander deck must contain exactly **100 cards**, including the commander itself. This means 99 cards in the main deck plus 1 commander in the command zone. The **singleton rule** means that aside from basic lands, no two cards in the deck can share the same English name. This restriction forces diversity and creativity — you cannot rely on drawing the same powerful card repeatedly.

### The Commander

The commander must be a **legendary creature** (or a card that specifically says it can be your commander, such as certain planeswalkers like Teferi, Temporal Archmage). The commander starts the game in the **command zone**, a special zone separate from the deck. You can cast your commander from the command zone at any time you could normally cast it.

### Commander Tax

Each time your commander is cast from the command zone beyond the first time, it costs an additional **{2} for each previous time** it was cast from the command zone. This is called the "commander tax." For example, if your commander costs 3 mana and has been cast from the command zone twice before, it now costs 3 + 4 = 7 mana. This mechanic prevents commanders from being endlessly replayable without cost and encourages players to protect their commander or build strategies that don't rely entirely on it.

When your commander would go to the graveyard or exile from anywhere, you may choose to put it back in the command zone instead. This ensures you always have access to your commander, but at increasing cost.

### Color Identity

A card's **color identity** includes all mana symbols in its mana cost and rules text (but not reminder text). Your deck can only contain cards whose color identity is a subset of your commander's color identity. For example, if your commander is Atraxa, Praetors' Voice (W/U/B/G), you cannot include any cards with red ({R}) in their color identity.

This rule fundamentally shapes deckbuilding. A mono-white commander can only use white and colorless cards, while a five-color commander like Kenrith, the Returned King can use every card in Magic. This is why colorless cards — which fit in any deck regardless of commander color — tend to be the most popular on EDHREC.

## Gameplay

### Life Total and Players

Commander games typically feature **4 players** in a free-for-all format, though it can be played with 2-6 players. Each player starts with **40 life** (compared to 20 in Standard). The higher life total and multiplayer nature make the format slower and more social — games typically last 60-90 minutes.

### Commander Damage

If a single commander deals **21 or more combat damage** to a single player over the course of the game, that player loses regardless of their life total. This is tracked per commander — if you take 15 damage from one commander and 10 from another, neither threshold is met. Voltron strategies (building up a single, massive commander) specifically exploit this alternate win condition.

### Multiplayer Dynamics

The 4-player format creates unique political dynamics not found in 1v1 Magic. Players negotiate, form temporary alliances, and make deals. A player who gets too far ahead will often face a 3v1 response from the table. This "threat assessment" dynamic means that cards which are strong in 1v1 may underperform in Commander (e.g., targeted discard like Thoughtseize) while cards that scale with multiple opponents thrive (e.g., Rhystic Study draws a card for each opponent who doesn't pay).

## Commander Staples

Certain cards appear in the vast majority of Commander decks because they are colorless (fit any deck) and provide universally useful effects:

- **Sol Ring** — 1-mana artifact that taps for 2 colorless mana. Found in approximately 67% of all Commander decks on EDHREC. It's the single most-played card in the format (EDHREC rank #1).
- **Command Tower** — A land that taps for any color in your commander's color identity. Essentially a free 5-color land in any multicolor deck. EDHREC rank consistently in the top 5.
- **Arcane Signet** — 2-mana artifact that taps for any color in your commander's color identity. Another universal mana rock that appears in the majority of decks.
- **Lightning Greaves** — 2-mana equipment that gives haste and shroud. Protects your commander and lets it attack immediately.
- **Swiftfoot Boots** — 2-mana equipment that gives haste and hexproof. Similar to Lightning Greaves but allows you to target the equipped creature.

## Banned List

The Commander format is governed by the **Commander Rules Committee** (RC), which maintains a banned list of cards considered too powerful, unfun, or disruptive for the social multiplayer experience. Notable bans include:

- **Sol Ring** is NOT banned despite its power — the RC considers it a fun, iconic part of the format
- **Flash** — banned because it enabled a turn-1 combo kill (Flash + Protean Hulk)
- **Biorhythm** — creates non-interactive game endings
- **Coalition Victory** — "I win" card that ends games anticlimactically
- **Recurring Nightmare** — too difficult to interact with, generates overwhelming advantage

The ban philosophy prioritizes the social contract and fun over competitive balance. Cards are banned for being "unfun" more often than for being "too strong." This differs from competitive formats like Standard where balance is the primary concern.

## Why Commander Is Popular

1. **Self-expression** — 100-card singleton means every deck is unique. Players express themselves through commander choice, theme, and card selection.
2. **Social gameplay** — Multiplayer politics, negotiation, and table talk create memorable stories.
3. **Accessibility** — No rotation means cards are legal forever (except bans). You can build one deck and play it for years.
4. **Power level flexibility** — Groups can agree on a power level from casual jank to competitive cEDH (competitive Elder Dragon Highlander).
5. **Commander products** — Wizards releases preconstructed Commander decks 4+ times per year, providing easy entry points for new players at $40-$50 each.

## Partner Commanders and Multiple Commanders

Some legendary creatures have the **Partner** keyword, allowing a player to have two commanders instead of one. The combined color identity of both partners determines which cards are legal in the deck. Partner was introduced in Commander 2016 and has appeared in several forms:

- **Partner** (original) — Can pair with any other creature that has Partner. Examples: Thrasios, Triton Hero (UG) paired with Tymna the Weaver (WB) gives access to WUBG (4 colors).
- **Partner with [specific card]** — Can only partner with the named card. Example: Brallin, Skyshark Rider partners with Shabraz, the Skyshark.
- **Friends Forever** — A variant from the Stranger Things Secret Lair, works like Partner but only with other Friends Forever creatures.
- **Background** — From Battle for Baldur's Gate, pairs a mono-colored commander with a Background enchantment.

Partner commanders are popular because they provide access to more colors, card advantage (two cards always available), and strategic flexibility. The Thrasios + Tymna pairing is one of the most popular cEDH pairings due to access to 4 colors plus built-in card advantage from both commanders.

## Deck Archetypes in Commander

Commander decks generally fall into several broad archetypes:

- **Aggro/Combat** — Win through creature damage. Voltron (powering up one creature, often the commander), go-wide tokens (creating many small creatures), or tribal aggro (Elves, Goblins, Zombies).
- **Control** — Slow the game with counterspells, removal, and board wipes, then win with a late-game finisher. Often blue-based (Azorius, Esper).
- **Combo** — Assemble a combination of cards that wins the game instantly or creates an insurmountable advantage. cEDH is heavily combo-oriented.
- **Midrange/Value** — Generate incremental advantage through powerful permanents. The most common archetype in casual Commander.
- **Stax** — Tax and restrict opponents' actions (Stasis, Winter Orb, Smothering Tithe). Slows the game to a crawl.
- **Group Hug** — Give resources to all players, then leverage the chaos. Politically-oriented.
- **Aristocrats** — Sacrifice creatures for value (Blood Artist, Zulaport Cutthroat drain life when creatures die).

## History and Evolution

Commander was created in the late 1990s by judges in Anchorage, Alaska, led by Sheldon Menery. Originally called Elder Dragon Highlander (EDH) because the original commanders were the five Elder Dragons from Legends (1994) — Nicol Bolas, Chromium, Arcades Sabboth, Vaevictis Asmadi, and Palladia-Mors.

Key milestones:
- **2006** — The format gains online traction through forums and articles
- **2011** — Wizards of the Coast releases the first official Commander preconstructed decks (Commander 2011), legitimizing the format
- **2016** — Commander 2016 introduces Partner commanders
- **2020** — Commander Legends, the first Commander-focused booster set, is released
- **2023** — Wizards of the Coast reports Commander is played in over 50% of all Magic sessions

## Competitive EDH (cEDH)

At the highest power level, Commander becomes cEDH — a fast, combo-oriented format where games often end by turn 3-5. cEDH decks run the most efficient interaction (Force of Will, Mana Drain, Pact of Negation) and fast mana (Mana Crypt, Chrome Mox, Mox Diamond). The most popular cEDH commanders include Thrasios/Tymna, Kenrith, and Najeela. cEDH represents a small but dedicated portion of the Commander community, and card preferences in cEDH differ significantly from casual Commander.

Key differences between cEDH and casual:
- **Budget**: cEDH decks often cost $1,000-$5,000+ while casual decks range from $50-$500
- **Speed**: cEDH games end on turns 3-5, casual games last 60-90 minutes
- **Win conditions**: cEDH uses compact 2-3 card combos (Thassa's Oracle + Demonic Consultation), while casual focuses on board presence
- **Interaction density**: cEDH runs 15-20+ pieces of interaction, casual runs 8-12
- **Mana optimization**: cEDH plays every legal fast mana source (Mana Crypt, Chrome Mox, Mox Diamond, Mana Vault, Grim Monolith), casual primarily uses Sol Ring and signets

## Power Level and the Rule Zero Conversation

Before a Commander game, players typically have a "Rule Zero" conversation to align on power level. The community generally recognizes these tiers:

- **Precon level (1-3)** — Unmodified preconstructed decks. Low synergy, inconsistent, but fun for new players.
- **Low power (4-5)** — Modified precons or budget brews. Casual, thematic, few tutors.
- **Mid power (6-7)** — Optimized casual decks. Strong synergies, efficient cards, but no infinite combos before turn 8+. This is where the majority of Commander games land.
- **High power (8-9)** — Highly tuned decks with powerful combos, expensive staples, and efficient interaction. On the border of cEDH.
- **cEDH (10)** — Fully optimized decks with the best cards available. Turn 3-5 wins are expected.

The power level discussion affects EDHREC data: most decklists submitted to public sites are mid-power (6-7), so EDHREC rankings primarily reflect mid-power card preferences rather than cEDH or casual extremes.

## Commander's Impact on Card Prices and Design

Commander is now the primary driver of Magic card prices in the secondary market. Cards that are staples in Commander but see no play in other formats (like Rhystic Study, Smothering Tithe, Dockside Extortionist) command premium prices purely due to Commander demand. Wizards of the Coast has responded by:

- Printing Commander-specific products multiple times per year
- Including Commander-focused cards in Standard sets
- Creating Commander-legal-only cards in supplemental products
- Reprinting Commander staples in Masters sets to manage prices

This feedback loop between Commander popularity, card design, and EDHREC rankings makes the format the center of Magic's ecosystem.
